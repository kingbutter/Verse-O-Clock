### v25.12.3 — Faithful Through the Storm

This release focuses on **resilience, clarity, and user trust**. Verse-O-Clock now behaves correctly across unreliable networks, provides clear visual feedback during boot and setup, and maintains uninterrupted operation once running — even if connectivity is lost.

The device now tells the truth about its state, without getting in the way.

## Highlights

Boot & Connectivity UX (Major)
- Added a **boot status screen** so the display never appears blank during startup
- Clear messaging during Wi-Fi connection attempts:
  - Shows the **saved SSID** when attempting to reconnect
  - Distinguishes between:
    - *No Wi-Fi configured*
    - *Saved Wi-Fi unavailable*
- Setup portal screen now accurately reflects **why** it appeared

This removes ambiguity during first-time setup and recovery scenarios.

Offline-Resilient Operation
- Once the clock has successfully started, it will **continue running indefinitely** if Wi-Fi or internet connectivity is lost
- The setup portal will **never interrupt a running clock**
- Internet loss no longer forces user interaction or mode changes

The clock remains a clock first — always.

Wi-Fi Status Indicator (New)
- Added a lightweight on-screen Wi-Fi indicator:
  - Normal icon when connected
  - Slashed icon when disconnected
- Provides passive awareness without disrupting the display

---

Setup Portal QR Improvements
- Restored and improved **dual QR codes** during setup:
  - “Join Setup Wi-Fi” QR for mobile devices
  - “Open Setup Portal” QR for configuration
- Mobile-first setup now works reliably again

---

Power-Off Screen Behavior (Fixed)
- “Safely power off” screen now appears **only when explicitly requested**
- Triggered exclusively by the **Power Off checkbox + Save**
- Prevents accidental or premature display changes during setup

Intentional actions now produce intentional results.

Technical Notes
- WiFiManager logic now distinguishes:
  - Historical Wi-Fi success
  - Saved credentials present this boot
  - Actual connection failure
- Setup reasons are determined post-connect attempt for accuracy
- Rendering logic prevents setup or power screens from overwriting active displays
- No changes to verse content, indexing, or LittleFS layout

---

- Fully compatible with Offline Mode
- No changes to verse selection or display cadence
- Safe upgrade from v25.12.2
