### v25.12.2 — The Word Abides

This release completes the separation of **firmware** and **verse content**, laying the groundwork for safer OTA updates, faster iteration on Bible data, and long-term device stability.

Verse-O-Clock devices can now rebuild or refresh their local verse store independently of firmware updates, while preserving the same offline-first philosophy.

## Highlights

Content Repository (New)
- Verse content is now treated as a first-class artifact
- Verse blobs are generated during CI:
  - `toc.bin`
  - `entries.bin`
  - `texts.bin`
- Content is published to a dedicated repository:
  - `Verse-O-Clock-Content`
- A `manifest.json` is generated with size and SHA-256 checksums

This decouples scripture data from firmware releases and enables safer recovery if local storage is missing or corrupted.

LittleFS Build Improvements
- LittleFS images are built in CI using the same resolution rules as the Arduino IDE
- `partitions.csv` is resolved in this order:
  1. Device-local `partitions.csv`
  2. Board’s built-in partition scheme
- Exact LittleFS size and offset are extracted automatically
- Generated artifacts:
  - `<DEVICE>_littlefs.bin`
  - `<DEVICE>_littlefs_offset.txt`

This ensures OTA, flashing tools, and local builds all agree on filesystem layout.

Build & Release Pipeline
- CI now produces three distinct artifact types:
  - Firmware binary
  - LittleFS image
  - Raw verse content blobs
- Release assets include:
  - `<DEVICE>_firmware.bin`
  - `<DEVICE>_littlefs.bin`
  - Verse content blobs + manifest
- Release titles and notes are sourced from `releases/<tag>.md`

The pipeline remains tag-driven and deterministic.

Technical Notes
- Verse content is generated via `build_verses_unishox.py`
- Content blobs are compressed and indexed for fast lookup
- SHA-256 checksums are recorded for future integrity verification
- Content publishing is guarded to a single device to prevent overwrite
- Fine-grained GitHub token is used for content repo writes

Compatibility
- Fully compatible with existing Offline Mode behavior
- Devices continue to operate entirely from LittleFS when offline
- No behavioral changes to verse selection or display logic

Supported Hardware
- Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3
- 7.5 inch e-Paper display (GDEY075T7 or equivalent)
- LittleFS partition for verse storage
