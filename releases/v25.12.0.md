### v25.12.0 — Initial Release "In The Beginning"

**Highlights**

* Time-matched Bible verse display: shows a real KJV verse aligned to the current time (e.g., 03:16 → John 3:16).
* Captive setup portal on first boot for Wi-Fi, timezone, and preferences.
* NTP time sync on startup with periodic correction.
* Ultra-low-power deep sleep between minute updates for long battery life.
* Offline verse storage using LittleFS + compressed verse data for fast lookup.

**Device Support**

* Seeed Studio **XIAO ESP32-C3**
* **7.5" 800×480** B&W e-Paper (SPI) (Waveshare/Seeed-compatible)

**Build & Flash**

* Arduino IDE build supported (ESP32 core + required libraries)
* Separate **LittleFS data upload** required (generated verse binaries live under each device `data/` folder)

**Developer Notes**

* Project structured to support **multiple devices** (one folder per device)
* Generated `.bin` verse data is intentionally not committed (reproducible via helper script)

**Known Notes / Gotchas**

* If the screen is blank or LittleFS fails to mount, confirm:

  * correct **Partition Scheme** selected 
  * verse data uploaded to **LittleFS** before first run
  * First boot may take longer while Wi-Fi + NTP are configured.
